## Error Log
As a developer, you spend a great part of your time chasing down errors. This means that a common task of your workflow will be checking your error log. Since you'll perform this task over and over again, you probably want to minimize the process. Oetzie introduced ErrorLog as a MODX Extra to give you (as a developer) a direct view on the error status of your MODX website.

By installing ErrorLog, an icon gets added to your MODX top navigation. In case your MODX website doesn't have any errors, a positive icon will be displayed. In case your MODX website DOES have any errors, a negative icon will be displayed. The negative icon comes with a number, telling you how many errors are currently active on your website. In short: ErrorLog allows you to see the error status of your MODX website very quickly, from every area of your MODX environment.

By clicking the error icon, you'll get direct access to the error log. There you have the options to refresh and clear your log.

## Installation ##
1. Install the Extra on your MODX website.
2. Refresh your page.
3. An icon should appear in the top right corner, next to the user image.

Access your error log by clicking the icon. Easy as that!

## Requirements ##
* MODX version 2.5.0 or newer has to be installed.
* The user needs to have the "error_log_view" permissions.
